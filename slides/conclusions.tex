    %Minimal workflow
    %\begin{itemize}
        %\item Track the status of your project using the GitLab Kanban board.
        %\item Learn and apply the very basics of git, understand the concepts behind branching, merging, commits and working with remote repositories.   
        %\item Integrate the changes that worked, don't leave 30 branches open. 
        %\item Format the data using established (open-source) formats if possible, if not, at least do this for secondary data (diagrams and tables). 
        %\item Share your secondary data on a (TUdatalib) data repository. 
        %\item Periodically cross-link research data: publication/report, scripts/code, secondary and primary data. 
    %\end{itemize}

%\begin{frame}{Lessons learned}
	%\vfill
        %\begin{itemize}
            %\item Keeping the workflow as simple as possible is crucial for acceptance.
            %\item Focusing on secondary data simplifies the workflow significantly.  
            %\item For simulations that run $<24$ hours primary data can be recomputed easily. 
            %\item Periodical cross-linking of research data is done quickly and it is very beneficial. 
            %\item Personal responsibility is crucial at University research groups: who are the maintainers? 
                %\begin{itemize}
                    %\item What are the incentives for maintainers? 
                %\end{itemize}
            %\item Fixing the (parallel) I/O of legacy scientific codes requires a large amount of effort. 
                %\begin{itemize}
                    %\item It should be done outside of research projects. 
                %\end{itemize}
        %\end{itemize}

%\begin{frame}{Outlook}
	%\vfill
	%\begin{itemize}
            %\item Performance CI jobs run on 64-core workstations: moving on to the HPC cluster. 
            %\item Singularity GitLab executor? 
            %\item Jupyter Hub for interactive analysis of problems in parameter variations?
            %\item Automatic publishing and cross-linking of CI artifacts? 
                %\begin{itemize}
                    %\item Source code archive, Singularity container, secondary data. 
                    %\item Data repository API must be used to modify metadata. 
                %\end{itemize}
